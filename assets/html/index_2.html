                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">Caltech 101 is a commonly used dataset for image classification research, consisting of images of 101 different categories of objects. About 40 to 800 images per category. Most categories have about 50 images. Collected in September 2003 by researchers(Fei-Fei Li, Marco Andreetto, and Marc'Aurelio Ranzato) and students at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). The size of each image is roughly 300 x 200 pixels. </p>

                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">ImageNet is a large-scale image database and a pivotal platform for visual recognition research. It houses over 14 million images spanning more than 20,000 categories, making it one of the most extensive datasets in the field of computer vision. Developed initially by Dr. Fei-Fei Li research Team at Stanford University, ImageNet serves as a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating image classification and object detection models.</p>

                    <p class="timeline__content-desc">This is a paper published in Nature, and according to Fei-Fei Li, it took 8 years to complete. The research team behind this paper included over a dozen Stanford undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral researchers, along with nearly ten doctors and professors from the same medical school. The paper cites and summarizes over a dozen AI papers and half a dozen medical journal articles.</p>
