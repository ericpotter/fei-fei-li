                        Chengdu,
                        Sichuan. At the age of 15, she relocated with her family to New Jersey, USA. </p>

                    <p class="timeline__content-desc"> In the initial years after arriving in the United States, the
                        Feifei family
                        faced financial challenges. Consequently, Li Feifei worked various jobs within the Chinese
                        community,
                        including dishwashing, serving, cleaning, and part-time household cleaning. Balancing learning
                        and
                        employment consumed most of her time, and during the most demanding periods, it is said she
                        could only
                        manage four hours of sleep per day. Eventually, her parents borrowed money from relatives and
                        friends to
                        establish a dry cleaning business.</p>

                        GPA in her
                        class. Her outstanding academic performance earned her a scholarship to Princeton University,
                        where she
                        pursued her undergraduate studies. During weekends, she frequently returned home to assist with
                        the family's
                        dry cleaning business. Throughout her college years, she also provided remote assistance to her

                        the customers of the dry cleaning store.</p>
