          <p class="timeline__content-desc">Li Feifei was born in Beijing, China in 1976 and grew up in Chengdu,
            Sichuan. At the age of 15, she relocated with her family to New Jersey, USA. </p>

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title"> </h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc"> In the initial years after arriving in the United States, the Feifei family
            faced financial challenges. Consequently, Li Feifei worked various jobs within the Chinese community,
            including dishwashing, serving, cleaning, and part-time household cleaning. Balancing learning and
            employment consumed most of her time, and during the most demanding periods, it is said she could only
            manage four hours of sleep per day. Eventually, her parents borrowed money from relatives and friends to
            establish a dry cleaning business.</p>

          <h2 class="timeline__content-title"> </h2>
          <p class="timeline__content-desc">Upon arriving in the United States, Li Feifei began learning English from
            scratch. However, she graduated from Parsippany High School in New Jersey with the sixth-highest GPA in her
            class. Her outstanding academic performance earned her a scholarship to Princeton University, where she
            pursued her undergraduate studies. During weekends, she frequently returned home to assist with the family's
            dry cleaning business. Throughout her college years, she also provided remote assistance to her parents and
            the customers of the dry cleaning store.</p>
